<p>A deck for the Colemak keyboard layout.</p>

<p>It's obviously not intended as a replacement for actual practice of using the keyboard, just as a replacement for hanging up the layout beside your screen (which is what's suggested on the main Colemak website).</p>

<p>The deck is "open source" and managed on <a href="https://github.com/aplaice/colemak_keyboard_layout">GitHub</a>, so please feel free to comment or post issues, there.</p>

<p>The deck contains media derived from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:KB_US-Colemak.svg">KB_US-Colemak.svg on Wikimedia</a>. The derivations, like the source, are licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0.</p>

<div>A deck for the Colemak keyboard layout.</div>

<div>It's obviously not intended as a replacement for actual practice of using the keyboard, just as a replacement for hanging up the layout beside your screen (which is what's suggested on the main Colemak website).</div>

<div>If you're doing this deck on desktop, it's recommended to switch to the Colemak keyboard layout to type the relevant keys.</div>

<div>The deck is "open source" and managed on <a href="https://github.com/aplaice/colemak_keyboard_layout">GitHub</a>, so please feel free to comment or post issues, there.</div>
